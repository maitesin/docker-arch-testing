# Arch Linux Docker VCA Testing Image

This container derives from
[vcatechnology/arch](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/arch) so that the
image has the latest [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/) packages. It then
installs packages needed for building markdown documentation.

Available on Docker Hub as [vcatechnology/arch-testing](https://hub.docker.com/r/vcatechnology/arch-testing/)
